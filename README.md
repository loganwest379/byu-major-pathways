BYU Marriott Major Match is an interactive web app built to help pre-business students at Brigham Young University explore their major options with confidence. Through a clean, BYU-branded interface, students can compare majors side-by-side, explore detailed career paths, take a 15-question major match quiz, and visualize outcomes with interactive tools.

Built with V0 and hosted via GitHub, this tool combines low-code development with thoughtful UX design to empower students in making one of their most important academic decisions.
